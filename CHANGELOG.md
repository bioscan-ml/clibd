# Update log

- **May 2024**: Initial release of the codebase. Using LoRA to fine-tune the pretrained encoders.
- **July 2024**: Added config file for training with BISOCAN-5M dataset. Added BZSL experiment with the INSECT dataset. Including the forked code from [Fine-Grained-ZSL-with-DNA] as a submodule.
- **August 2024**: Supported training with full fine-tuning and added correlated config files.
- **October 2024**: Supported training with /without auto mixed precision, fix/trainable temperature. Added embeddings and model checkpoints for BIOSCAN-5M. Update the code for embedding visualization and image retrieval.
- **December 2024**: Code refactor.
- **February 2025**: Updated the expired embedding and pre-trained model links in the README.
- **Future**: Support training with new BarcodeBERT that pre-trained with the BIOSCAN-5M dataset.
